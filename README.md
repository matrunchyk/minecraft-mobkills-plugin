### Features

- When the player kills a zombie by a wooden shovel, the zombie turns into a giant walking zombie which follows the player and throws fireballs.
- A creeper can be tamed by the player by killing the creeper by a wooden shovel. The tamed player still follows the player but makes ho harm to him even if it explodes. A tamed creeper glows and can be super charged by interacting to the creeper. Warning! You have 10 seconds to RUN - it will strike the creeper with a lightning bolt and making a HUGE explosion!
- When the player throws a cake into another player, "Happy birthday song" is played and it shows "Happy birthday! <Player name> shares a cake with you" message on the whole screen.
- When the player types /daddy-power chat command, the "Daddy Power" is activated, which gives netherite tools, weapon, armor, with TOP-tier echancements and applies best effects for 1h to the player. It also gives 100 XP levels and allows the player to fly (the fly mode is active for 15 minutes, the player will see the message 1 minute before deactivating the fly mode).
