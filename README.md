### Features

- When the player kills a zombie with a wooden shovel, the zombie turns into a giant walking zombie that follows the player and throws fireballs.

- A creeper can be tamed by the player by killing the creeper with a wooden shovel. The tamed creeper still follows the player but does not harm them even if it explodes. A tamed creeper glows and can be supercharged by interacting with it. Warning! You have 10 seconds to RUN - it will strike the creeper with a lightning bolt, causing a HUGE explosion!

- When the player throws a cake at another player, the "Happy Birthday" song is played, and a "Happy Birthday! \<Player name\> shares a cake with you" message is displayed on the whole screen.

- When the player types the /daddy-power chat command, the "Daddy Power" is activated, which gives the player Netherite tools, weapons, and armor with top-tier enhancements, and applies the best effects for 1 hour. It also gives the player 100 XP levels and allows them to fly (the fly mode is active for 15 minutes, and the player will see a message 1 minute before the fly mode is deactivated).
